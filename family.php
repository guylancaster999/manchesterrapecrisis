As a			'safe' person to tell, you are a woman's most important source of			support. </p>			<p>Whether you are helping someone cope with the immediate trauma of a			recent experience or someone coming to terms with sexual abuse suffered			as a child, you are very important to them. It is important, therefore,			that you see yourself as important here and take care of yourself and			your own needs. The victim is not going to get over the trauma quickly,			so you need to pace yourself in terms of how much time and energy you			can realistically offer the woman whom you are supporting. Consistency			over a long period is more important than sitting up all night for a			week and setting up expectations that you will always be able to 'be			there' for her.</p>			<p>Similarly, remember that she is not 'rejecting' you if she chooses			to seek help elsewhere, such as from a counsellor. When someone is in			shock, grieving or traumatised, they will not look after themselves			very well; they can be overwhelmed with painful emotions and negative			thoughts. You need to be able to feel calm and be 'real'. Hot drinks,			food, vitamins, treats and a hand to hold may be all the person needs			from you. Victims have had their minds and bodies invaded; they may			have difficulties in sleeping, eating, and bathing, relaxing and not			least with sexual or intimate contact. It may take time for these			activities to become normalised as every day life; any support you can			offer in this process can add a lot to their sense of security and			self-respect.			</p>			<p>Many people are afraid of saying or doing 'the wrong thing', or of			'damaging' someone further because they 'do not know enough' about			sexual violence. It is important to remember that you do not have to be			an expert, you are not dealing with a 'strange disease'. If you are			prepared to listen, the woman concerned will be able to guide you in			what she needs.			</p>			<p>You may feel traumatised, confused, overwhelmed, or a range of			feelings about what has happened, you may feel: angry, helpless,			guilty, scared, upset, nervous. These feelings are natural, it is			important that you deal with these away from the victim, try not to			dump them on her. Talk to a friend or someone whom you can trust, with			permission from the victim of course, arrange to get support from			agencies near you.			</p>			<p>Victims are often afraid of how other people will react to what has			happened to them, they may fear not being believed, embarrassment,			having their experiences minimised or trivialised, even fear rejection.			Women often fear well-meaning, but ignorant questions such as: "Why			didn't you tell me before now?" "Why didn't you scream?" "Why didn't			you tell someone?" "Why don't you report it to the police?" "Why did			you (encourage him / wear that skirt / walk that route / etc.)?" If you			do not understand why a victim is behaving in a particular way, or is			reacting the way she is now, remember that this is your problem, not			hers. Do not badger her with questions or ask her questions, which you			are not sure, whether she will want to answer; read a book instead.			</p>			<p>The woman may have her own questions about what has happened to her			and may want to explore these with you. It is very important that she			makes up her own mind and finds her own truth about what has happened			to her and makes her own decisions from it. Sexual abuse and violence			leaves women with feelings of powerlessness and loss of control about			their lives. It is important that people do not take over, without			consulting with the woman about what she needs in the situation.			Confronting the perpetrator, phoning the police, or making a medical			appointment 'on her behalf' may make matters worse, you can best help			by listening to her and asking her or checking out what she wants; do			not tell her what you believe she ought to do; explore her options with			her.			</p>			<p>No two people are the same and reactions to rape and sexual abuse			are as varied as they are to bereavement. It is likely, however, that			whatever her experience, at some point she feared for her life and that			she will feel numb after the attack, 'cut off', in shock or even			hysterical; she may appear perfectly calm and unaffected; she may fear			that she is 'going mad'; these are all normal ways for a woman to			process what has happened to her. Other effects may be flashbacks or			panic attacks. Her behaviour may change: her eating habits may alter,			she may feel the need to wash repeatedly. She may vomit or have other			physical symptoms. All of these problems are alleviated by being able			to talk about them; repetition of the trauma is common - try to be			patient.</p>			<p>			Victims whose story has not been believed by others may find it very			difficult to trust anyone else and may resist talking about their			experiences. Do not take this as your not being 'good enough' to trust,			be patient and encourage her gently, do not push her. If you feel the			need to press her, ask yourself why you 'need to know' now. Her			apparently frozen state will not last forever.			</p>			<p>As time passes, a woman may go through emotional and psychological			change. She may be adding to her trauma by blaming herself and			tormenting herself with 'what ifs' or about her behaviour before,			during and/or after what has happened. Remind her at these times that			it is never a woman's fault that she has been violated, it was the			attackers decision to act in the way he did. Rape is never 'asked for'			and it can be hard for a woman to face just how powerless she was in			the abusive situation. Thinking that she could have done something			different is a way of a woman 'problem solving' so that they can			protect themselves in the future. These are complex issues, which can			sometimes require specialist support. Rape Crisis Centre can help.			</p>			<p>The changes which she goes through as a result of the trauma may be			difficult for you to keep up with, it is important that you talk to			someone in confidence at these times, or you may become too stressed to			deal with what is happening with her. It is important to get support			for yourself. Carers need carers too. Resist any request to be 'sworn			to secrecy', you may need to talk to someone at some point, be honest			about his with her.</p>		</div> 	</div>	<div class="row">	<div class="col-5 col-sm-5 col-md-5 col-lg-5">&nbsp;</div>		<div class="col-2 col-sm-2 col-md-2 col-lg-2">  				<?php foot();?>		</div>	</div></div></body></html>
