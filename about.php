Today MRC continues to support women who have been raped or sexually abused, including women who have been or are involved in sex work. </li>	<li class="description">MRC is based in a local women&#39;s centre. Women who access the services of Manchester Rape Crisis can access other activities at the centre such as drop-in groups, educational classes and alternative therapy groups. </li><li class="description">MRC also offers informal support and advocacy to women; for example, we are involved in supporting asylum seeking women who have experienced rape and torture in their home countries. </li></ul><br/><h4>MRC is a vital charity, which aims to support, believe and listen to women who have been raped or sexually abused.</h4> <div id="main">      <h3>Contact us</h3>      <p><img class="image" alt="email and letters image" src="images/contact.jpg">      </p>
